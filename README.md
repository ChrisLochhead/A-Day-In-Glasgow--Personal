# A-Day-In-Glasgow--Personal

A small text-based RPG I adapted from a previous submission in my second year of university.
Features experimentation with engine design principles; such as patterns, singletons and super classes.

This text-based demo features a simple story of a young person from edinburgh trying to survive in the rougher area's of Glasgow,
whilst trying to keep their wits as they see increasingly bizarre and unruly behaviour from it's residents. Whether they encounter individuals
of lively dispositions (neds), corrupt taxi drivers and gang members, you can bet this is a trip they wont soon forget!

While being a simple concept, the code itself demonstrates my ability to use a number of design principles for efficiently creating a game, 
resembling a mini-game engine in ways. This was supposed to be a three man project, however due to unforseeable circumstances, all of the work in 
this repo is my own.

There are no dependencies outside of the standard C++ library used in this game.
